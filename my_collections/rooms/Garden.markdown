Trezeniam has a very sunny small front garden and parking for 4 or 5 cars. The drive is shared with simon next door but we are always considerate to our neighbours.

The back garden is on several levels and can be steep in places. There is a small stone courtyard outside the back door and steps go up to first level where there is a garden shed. The key to which is on Trezeniams back door keys. In the shed are extra garden chairs a folding table and a barbecue on wheels - and a hammock to go on the top level. Our guests can use anything in the graden\shed or garage.

The washing line is a pull out one and goes from the fence on the right looking up the garden to a hook on the shed.
