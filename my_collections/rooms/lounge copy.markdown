The lounge has seating for at least 9 and has 3 leather sofas. 2 x 2 person and a 3 person. There are also a couple of single chairs and a foot stool (popular with the children) :).

The TV has Freesat available and for our guests a Netflix account is linked - useful for those rainy days or evenings.
