Trezeniam has 4 bedrooms. 2 downstairs. The bedrooms downstairs have been renovated since these pictures were taken. 
The fibreboard ceilings have been removed and replaced. 
The central lights are now modern LEDs and the rooms have been repainted in a neutral magenta.

 Both with double beds and sinks (perhaps from a time when the property was used as a Bed and Breakfast)

The 2 upstairs bedrooms have twin beds in both rooms. Ceiling is only 6 feet high here so ideal for children or the smaller adults!
