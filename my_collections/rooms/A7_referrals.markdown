"Trezeniam is a really comfortable property for families and groups of friends. 

The location is superb - a few mins walk from the beach and steps away from a cafe so no worries about finding a parking space in peak season.

Trevaunance Cove has a great pub plus other seaside attractions - ice cream anybody? 

The Cornish coastal path is accessible from nearby with rewarding views over to Perranporth. 

A stroll into the centre of St Agnes will delight with quirky shops, decent pubs and great restaurants.  St Agnes is also a great base from which to explore further afield in Cornwall and the property has lots of helpful information and ideas if required. The hosts are very approachable and knowledgeable about the area. Highly recommended."
