The kitchen has been repainted since these pictures. The kitchen is fully fitted and has a washing machine and dishwasher. 

The tumble dryer is currently in the garage but we have a cunning plan to bring it into the house.

The kitchen is a home from home including breadmaker and rice machine. We always welcome feedback on what our guests miss in the kitchen and typically supply that for your next visit.

The TV in the dining room also has Freesat available and for our guests a Netflix account is linked - useful for those rainy days or evenings.
