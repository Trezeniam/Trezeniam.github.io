Welcome to our website about "Trezeniam" our home from home.

Catherine, Steve and family have been lucky enough to own Trezeniam since September 2006.

We had been looking for a property for 5 or 6 years and had made many trips down to Cornwall looking at places such as Porthcurno and Sennen. But we decided we really liked the North Coast and somewhere Portreath\Porthtowan or St. Agnes would be ideal. Trezeniam was the last house we looked at in February half-term 2006 and we exchanged once the holiday season had finished in September 2006.

The links on the site should be relatively self-explantory. Most are links to areas of the property. The calendar shows bookings. The link to St.Agnes gives information about the village. Over time we will add more blog posts. Maybe we could add your contribution? 

For those interested the tools used to build the website are in the "About" link.
