St. Agnes is a lovely village on the North Coast of Cornwall.

With pubs open all year round, lovely walks and cycling and the stunning beach at Trevaunance Cove where you get the most marvellous sunsets.

Trezeniam in St. Agnes makes a great location for exploring Cornwall and particularly West Cornwall - all the way down to Lands End.

Being an AONB (Area of Outstanding Beauty) and a Mining History site there is loads to explore. From the beach with rock pools, caves and the old harbour to the designated Dark Sky at night (bring your Telescope)
