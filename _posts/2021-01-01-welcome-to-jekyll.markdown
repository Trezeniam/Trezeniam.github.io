Trezeniam has 4 bedrooms. 2 downstairs - both with double beds and sinks (perhaps from a time when the property was used as a Bed and Breakfast)

The 2 upstairs bedrooms have twin beds in both rooms. The bedroom on the right as you look up the stairs is also capable of having a pull out bed to make 9 in total.
